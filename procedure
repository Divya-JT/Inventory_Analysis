Here’s a structured plan reorganizing everything you’ve done so far into five business objectives with their respective technical components:

🎯 1. Optimal Inventory Level
Goal: Maintain ideal stock to meet demand without overstocking

✅ Components:
EOQ Calculation
→ Uses annual_demand, order_cost, holding_cost

ROP + Safety Stock
→ Uses forecasted daily_demand, lead_time, std_dev, and service level

Forecasted Demand
→ Prophet/ARIMA model on sales data
→ Output used in ROP and procurement planning

✅ Output:
EOQ, ROP, safety_stock, and forecasted_demand columns in report

Automate using inventory_report_pipeline.py

🎯 2. Reduce Stockouts and Excess Inventory
Goal: Balance under- and over-stocking using alerts and insights

✅ Components:
Inventory Health Flags
→ Alert if onhand < ROP or onhand > EOQ * 2

ABC Analysis
→ Prioritize A items for tighter control

Demand Forecast Integration
→ Align reordering with future demand

✅ Output:
action_flag column → Reorder Now, Overstocked, etc.

Dashboard filters to monitor real-time issues

🎯 3. Analyze Turnover and Carrying Cost
Goal: Monitor how efficiently inventory is used and stored

✅ Components:
Inventory Turnover Ratio & DIO
→ Based on annual_sales_value and average inventory

Carrying Cost Estimation
→ Use price, onhand, and storage % (e.g. 20%)

Turnover Category Flag
→ Fast-moving, Moderate, Slow-moving

✅ Output:
inventory_turnover, DIO, carrying_cost, turnover_category

🎯 4. Streamline Procurement and Production
Goal: Reduce delays and inefficiencies in purchasing

✅ Components:
Lead Time Analysis
→ Calculate avg_lead_time and std_dev from invoice_purchase.csv

Vendor Performance
→ Identify consistent vs. erratic suppliers

Procurement Triggers
→ ROP-based reordering logic per item

✅ Output:
Vendor-level report with avg_lead_time, lead_time_std

Integration into ROP formula

action_flag to drive procurement decisions

🎯 5. Develop Sustainable Inventory Strategy
Goal: Long-term cost-efficiency, reduced waste, and agile operations

✅ Components:
Overstock Monitoring on C Items
→ Reduce obsolete/slow stock

Inventory Aging & DIO
→ Cut down holding duration

Sales-to-Inventory Efficiency
→ Use turnover and forecast trends

Automated Reporting Pipeline
→ CSV in → AI processing → report out

Streamlit Dashboard
→ Live visual KPIs and item-level insights

✅ Output:
final_inventory_report.csv

demand_forecast.csv

Streamlit app for decision-makers

🧩 Recommended File Outputs
File	Purpose
inventory_report_pipeline.py	Generates full report (EOQ, ROP, turnover, flags)
demand_forecast.csv	6-month rolling forecast per product
final_inventory_report.csv	Merged actionable insights
app.py (Streamlit)	Live dashboard

🔧 1. Data Preparation
Merge and clean datasets:

Match InventoryId across beginventory, endinv, sales, purchase

Link VendorNumber to invoices and prices

Standardize date formats and remove duplicates/nulls

📊 2. Core Inventory KPIs
EOQ (Economic Order Quantity):
Use Demand, Order Cost, and Holding Cost
EOQ = √(2 × Demand × Ordering Cost / Holding Cost)

ROP + Safety Stock (Reorder Point):
ROP = (Lead Time × Avg Daily Demand) + Safety Stock
Safety Stock = Z × σ(Lead Time Demand)

Forecasted Demand:

Time series model on SalesQuantity using moving averages, Prophet, or LSTM

ABC Analysis:

Based on annual consumption value: SalesQuantity × SalesPrice

Inventory Turnover Ratio & DIO:

Turnover = COGS / Avg Inventory

DIO = 365 / Inventory Turnover

Carrying Cost Estimation:

= % Carrying Cost × Avg Inventory Value

Turnover Category Flags:

High-turnover, medium, low (based on percentiles or business thresholds)

🚦 3. Inventory Health Monitoring
Inventory Health Flags:

Overstock, Understock, Dead Stock, Aged Inventory

Inventory Aging:

Calculate days on hand based on startDate vs current date

Sales-to-Inventory Efficiency:

Sales Ratio = Sales / Avg Inventory

⚙️ 4. Procurement & Vendor Analytics
Streamline Procurement & Production:

Match PONumber, ReceivingDate, and Lead Times

Lead Time Analysis:

ReceivingDate - PODate

Vendor Performance:

On-time rate, quality metrics, cost-effectiveness

Procurement Triggers:

Trigger orders based on ROP, lead time, and forecasted demand

🌿 5. Strategic & Sustainable Inventory
Sustainable Inventory Strategy:

Optimize for reduced waste, energy use, and better service levels

Overstock Monitoring on C Items:

C items with low turnover or high on-hand → flag for markdown or liquidation

📈 6. Reporting & Dashboard
Automated Reporting Pipeline:

Use Python (Pandas, Plotly, Seaborn), schedule jobs with cron or Airflow

Streamlit Dashboard:

Visualize:

ABC Analysis (Pie chart)

Turnover/DIO trends (Line chart)

Aging inventory (Heatmap)

Vendor scorecard (Table)

EOQ/ROP alerts (Notifications)
